This repository contains three files:

1.-This file.
2.-UPCATRIALMODEL.tar.gz
3.-A version of the gnu scientific library.

An updated version of the  gsl library can be obtained 
at: http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl

Here it is only distributed for completeness, because the code 
relies heavily on the library so it should be instaled in your system.

The code is contained in the file UPCatrialCell.c which is located within the 
bundle UPCATRIALMODEL.tar.gz alongside a folder called SAMPLEOUTPUT, which contains
results obtained by running the code as it is packed here.

The parameters chosen are: 
Stimulus period Ts=400 ms, 
Recovery time 200ms (healthy cell) and 700ms for the alternating cell.

All the output files consist of three columns which correspond to time, Healthy Cell and
Alternating Cell signals respectively.

Also in the bundle, a shell script file called 'atriacompile' is included which should work
on any standard local gsl instalation, it executes the line:

cc -I/usr/local/include -o AtrialCell UPCatrialCell.c -L/usr/local/lib -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm

If the installation paths of the library are different they can be found by
executing:

gsl-config --libs --cflags

in a terminal (Unix/Mac OS).
