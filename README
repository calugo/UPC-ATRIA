This repository contains three files:

1.-This readme file.
2.-UPCATRIALMODEL.tar.gz
3.-A version of the gnu scientific library.

A current version of the  gsl library can be obtained 
at: 

http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl

Here is only distributed for completeness, the code 
relies heavily on the library. So a working version 
of it should be in your system.

The code is contained in the file UPCatrialCell.c contained in the 
bundle UPCATRIALMODEL.tar.gz alongside a test output contained in the folder 
SAMPLEOUTPUT.

The parameters chosen are stimulus period Ts=400 ms, recovery time 200ms for 
a healthy cell and Ts=700ms for the alternating cell.

All the resultant files contain three columns, which correspond to time, Healthy Cell and
Alternating Cell, respectively.


A shell script file called 'atriacompile' is included which should work
on any standard local gsl instalation, it executes:

cc -I/usr/local/include -o AtrialCell UPCatrialCell.c -L/usr/local/lib -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm

If the instalation paths of the library are different they can be found by
executing:

gsl-config --libs --cflags

in a terminal (Unix/Mac OS).
