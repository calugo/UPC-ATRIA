This file.\r\n2. UPCATRIALMODEL.tar.gz: C version of the program.\r\n3. A version of the gnu scientific library.\r\n4. UPCATRIALMODELF.tar.gz: Fortran version of the program.\r\n\r\n## The gnu scientific library:\r\n\r\nAn updated version of the  gsl library alongside installation instructions can\r\nbe obtained\r\nat: http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl\r\n\r\nHere it is only distributed for completeness, because the code heavily relies on\r\nthe library, so it should be installed in your system.\r\n\r\n## The C version bundle: UPCATRIALMODEL.tar.gz\r\n\r\nOnce you have extracted the files in the compressed file you will find:\r\n\r\n1. The source code itself, which is contained in the file UPCatrialCell.c\r\n1. A folder called SAMPLEOUTPUT, which contains results obtained by running the\r\ncode as it is packed in the bundle.\r\n1. A shell script in a file called 'atriacompile'\r\n\r\nThe parameters chosen to produce the sample results are:\r\n\r\n* Stimulus period Ts=400 ms.\r\n* Recovery times of 200ms (healthy cell) and 700ms for the alternating cell.\r\n\r\nAll the output files consist of three columns which correspond to time, healthy\r\ncell and\r\nalternating cell signals respectively.\r\n\r\nThe codes does not starts writin outputs until a number of iterations are first\r\ncalculated, so it only prints\r\nvalues closer or at the stationary state.\r\n\r\n### Compilation and Execution (Unix/Mac OS).\r\n\r\nThe script 'atriacompile' executes the line:\r\n\r\n`$cc -I/usr/local/include -o AtrialCell UPCatrialCell.c -L/usr/local/lib -lgsl\r\n-lgslcblas -lm`\r\n\r\nIf the installation paths of the library are different they can be found by\r\nexecuting:\r\n\r\n`$gsl-config --libs --cflags`\r\n\r\nIf the code links and compiles correctly it generates the file:  `AtrialCell`,\r\nwhich should\r\nbe run in a terminal as:\r\n\r\n`$ ./AtrialCell`\r\n\r\n## Fortran Bundle: UPCATRIALMODELF.tar.gz\r\n\r\nThis contains a fortran source `UPC-ATRIALCELL.f` and a binary file `check.dat`.\r\n\r\n### Compilation and Execution (Unix/Mac OS)\r\n\r\nTo compile the code type in UNIX/MAC OS, type in a terminal:\r\n\r\n`$gfortran -o exfilename sourcefilename.f`\r\n\r\nthen run:\r\n\r\n`$./exfilename`\r\n\r\nThe binary file  `check.dat` is read at the beginning of the execution and it\r\ncontains the initial data obtained for\r\nTs=1000 ms which are then evaluated for other pacing values (*Tsvalue*). Then,\r\nthe outcomes are written in another binary file called `output.dat.Tsvalue`.\r\n\r\nIt also writes standard text files for the time evolution of the voltage and\r\nevery Calcium concentration\r\n(`volt.dat.Tsvalue`) and a file with the action potential duration APD(DI)\r\n(`rest0dss.dat`).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
